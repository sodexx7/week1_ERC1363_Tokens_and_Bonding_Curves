# ERC777 and ERC1363


## 1. What problems ERC777 and ERC1363 solves?

While interacting with the ERC20 token, the received contract can't control the effects after transferring, or the sender can't do more needed operations before sending. 
    
Such as when sending an ERC20 token to a contract, but the contract can't reject or do more custom operations for convenience.

Sometimes the operators should operate on behalf of the ERC20 token owner. The owner needs to do two steps. One is to grant how many tokens the operator can handle, then transfer tokens. This leads to bad UX.     

    

## 2. Why was ERC1363 introduced, and what issues are there with ERC777?

The reason that ERC1363 was introduced as ERC777, Transforming the approve-transfer from two steps to the one-step, Making the received contract can reject or do more operations when receiving ERC20 tokens.

The ERC777 brings more flexibility to the received contract, but this leads to re-entrance problems, which means transferring the ERC777 token to a smart contract, which can register a malicious contract that can take on the execution and re-call the caller contract.

ERC1363 use a separate funciton such as transferFromAndCall(transferAndCall)  while ERC777 also use the funciton transfer(transferFrom).
